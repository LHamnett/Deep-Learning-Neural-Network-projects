# Machine_learning_projects
Repo containing some computer vision and NLP projects I have completed.

In the **computer vision** folder, we have the following projects:

1. Land_use_satellite_classifier_tensorflow - **image classifer** to determine from satellite images if the area next to a road is in an urban or rural area. This was used to generate a safety score for a particular stretch of road.                
2. Roman_numeral_classification_tensorflow - **image classifier** to identify handwritten roman numerals
3. MNIST_digit_classification_tensorflow - basic image classifier on the well known MNIST dataset                
4. Scenery_classifier_tensorflow - **image classifier** using transfer learning to determine which of 6 classes is being shown in a photograph of a natural or urban area. 
5. Pipeline_optimisation_for_image_augmentation_tensorflow - **building a tensorflow pipeline** to efficiently apply image transformations and augmentations to image datasets. Could process ~40,000 images in 2 or 3 seconds.
6. Synthetic_image_generation - using command line tools to **generate synthetic images** for a data driven machine learning competition
7. Road_location_satellite_GAN_tensorflow - Using a **GAN** to look at satellite images of a road and then create an image mask highlighting the pixel location of the road passing through the image. Used to identify road features and predict a road safety score. 

In the **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** folder, we have the following projects:

1.  Essay_grader_tensorflow - Building a tensorflow model to parse an essay written by a student and **predict the grade** which the teacher would award for a certain essay.
2.  Movie_review_sentiment_classification_tensorflow - building a tensorflow model to perform **sentiment analaysis** on movie reviews and determine if the review is positive or neagtive in nature. 

In the other section:

1. Audiobook_marketing_prediction_tensorflow - **predicting** if a company customer is likely **to be a return customer** based on website usage patterns
